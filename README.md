- The compliance of superannuation funds is monitored by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

## Trusteeâ€™s Responsibilities
- The trustee must file an annual Fund Income Tax Return with the ATO and ensure they act honestly and in the best interests of fund members.
